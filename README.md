## To develop

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.
* Fork and clone the project:

```
> $ git clone https://github.com/alicoding/react-webpack-babel.git
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
> $ npm install
```

Install webpack and the development server:

```
> $ npm i webpack-dev-server webpack -g
```

You can simply run webpack build using this command: 

```
> $ npm run build
```

If you want to run with webpack-dev-server simply run this command: 

```
> $ npm run dev
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8080/`

Please contribute to the project if you think this can be done better in anyway even for this README :)
